>Adds partial support for Anki **2.1.49+**. There are still issues with some features, but it should be usable for the most part.

Add readings and pitch accent information to Japanese words, allows playing audio when clicking a word, export pitch accent graphs, convert to katakana, or historical kanji and kana and much more!
